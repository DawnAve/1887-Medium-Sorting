# 1887-Medium-Sorting
Reduction to equal

Two solutions are provided. The weird one is, of course, weird, it uses a way that is hard to understand but runs perfectly fine. 
The logic is easy, and the coding is also quite easy, at least not hard. 
So the problem here is how to find a way that fits the problem.

The solution uses the reversed sorted array, which coincides with the idea of reducing the largest number(s) to the second largest value.
The weird one is being weird at this point. There is no sorting, no reductions, but runs. Interesting.
